My source code detects the 'fist' using the Haar cascade (OpenCV) mentioned in the below link via the video cam. Based on the fist position the mouse pointer is assigned the location and the process repeats in infinite loop. As a result we can control the mouse using the fist gesture 

The code is still in early stage of development and has a lot of scope for improvement.

The code.py contains the source code which uses the two Haar cascades Which I used from 

https://github.com/Balaje/OpenCV/tree/master/haarcascades

Future Scope:- 
The code can be pushed on the GPU (PyCuda) using Anaconda
Also more hand gestures can be used for multiple mouse functions
